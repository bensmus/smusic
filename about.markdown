Smusic is a music blog! It is a way of sharing overly detailed thoughts about music. Each post will have some songs and something (hopefully) interesting about them.

Some topics we'll discuss incude:

- chord progressions
- rhythm
- sound design
- the emotional effect of music (_yuck_)
- how music amplifies multimedia experiences
- and more!

Don't worry, I'll be giving primers on music theory when applicable.
